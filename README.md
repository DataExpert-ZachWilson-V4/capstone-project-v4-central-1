Objectives:

Data Collection:

Twitter API: Use the Twitter API to gather tweets mentioning various sneaker brands and models.
Sneaker DWebsites: Collect data by web scraping sneaker websites which includes detailed information about different sneaker models, release dates, and other relevant metadata.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the collected data to remove noise, handle missing values, and prepare it for analysis. This includes tokenizing text, removing stop words, and handling special characters and hashtags.

Sentiment Analysis: Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques and sentiment analysis models to classify the sentiment of the tweets and sneaker reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.

Trend Analysis: Identify trends and patterns in the sentiment data over time, across different brands and models. Analyze how sentiment correlates with sneaker release dates, features, and other metadata from Sneaker DB.

Visualization: Create visualizations to present the findings, such as sentiment distribution, trend graphs, and word clouds highlighting common themes in the reviews and tweets.

Methodology:

Data Collection: Utilize the Twitter API for gathering tweets and access Sneaker websites for detailed sneaker information.
Preprocessing: Use Python libraries like Pandas and NLTK for data cleaning and preprocessing.
Sentiment Analysis: Implement sentiment analysis.
Visualization: Use Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for creating insightful visualizations, present in Tableau.


We expect to conduct a comprehensive analysis of consumer sentiment towards various sneaker brands and models based on Twitter data and Sneaker DB information.
Insights into what features or aspects (e.g., comfort, design, price) drive positive or negative sentiment.
Identification of emerging trends and consumer preferences in the sneaker market.
