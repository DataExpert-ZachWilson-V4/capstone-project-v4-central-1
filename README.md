# Capstone Project: The Sentiment Analysis of Sneakers

## Project Overview
This capstone project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on customer reviews and social media discussions about sneakers. The goal is to analyze public sentiment towards different sneaker brands, models, and releases, providing insights into consumer preferences and trends.

## Objectives
1. **Data Collection:**
   - **Twitter API:** Use the Twitter API to gather tweets mentioning various sneaker brands and models.
   - **Sneaker Websites:** Collect data by web scraping sneaker websites which includes detailed information about different sneaker models, release dates, and other relevant metadata.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the collected data to remove noise, handle missing values, and prepare it for analysis. This includes tokenizing text, removing stop words, and handling special characters and hashtags.

3. **Sentiment Analysis:** Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques and sentiment analysis models to classify the sentiment of the tweets and sneaker reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.

4. **Trend Analysis:** Identify trends and patterns in the sentiment data over time, across different brands and models. Analyze how sentiment correlates with sneaker release dates, features, and other metadata from sneaker websites.

5. **Visualization:** Create visualizations to present the findings, such as sentiment distribution, trend graphs, and word clouds highlighting common themes in the reviews and tweets.

## Methodology
- **Data Collection:** Utilize the Twitter API for gathering tweets and access sneaker websites for detailed sneaker information.
- **Preprocessing:** Use Python libraries like Pandas and NLTK for data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Implement sentiment analysis using pre-trained models like VADER or fine-tune BERT models for more accurate results.
- **Visualization:** Use Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for creating insightful visualizations, presented in Tableau.

## Expected Outcomes
- A comprehensive analysis of consumer sentiment towards various sneaker brands and models based on Twitter data and sneaker website information.
- Insights into what features or aspects (e.g., comfort, design, price) drive positive or negative sentiment.
- Identification of emerging trends and consumer preferences in the sneaker market.

## Conclusion
This project will provide valuable insights for sneaker manufacturers and retailers to understand consumer sentiment and improve their products and marketing strategies accordingly.
