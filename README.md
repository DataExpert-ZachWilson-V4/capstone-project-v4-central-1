# Capstone Project: The Sentiment Analysis of Sneakers

## Project Overview
This capstone project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on customer reviews and social media discussions about sneakers. The goal is to analyze public sentiment towards different sneaker brands, models, and releases, providing insights into consumer preferences and trends.

## Objectives
1. **Data Collection:**
   - **Twitter API:** Use the Twitter API to gather tweets mentioning various sneaker brands and models.
   - **Sneaker Websites:** Collect data by web scraping sneaker websites which includes detailed information about different sneaker models, release dates, and other relevant metadata.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the collected data to remove noise, handle missing values, and prepare it for analysis. This includes tokenizing text, removing stop words, and handling special characters and hashtags.

3. **Sentiment Analysis:** Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques and sentiment analysis models to classify the sentiment of the tweets and sneaker reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.

4. **Trend Analysis:** Identify trends and patterns in the sentiment data over time, across different brands and models. Analyze how sentiment correlates with sneaker release dates, features, and other metadata from sneaker websites.

5. **Visualization:** Create visualizations to present the findings, such as sentiment distribution, trend graphs, and word clouds highlighting common themes in the reviews and tweets.

## Methodology
- **Data Collection:** Utilize the Twitter API for gathering tweets and access sneaker websites for detailed sneaker information.
- **Preprocessing:** Use Python libraries like Pandas and NLTK for data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Implement sentiment analysis using pre-trained models like VADER or fine-tune BERT models for more accurate results.
- **Visualization:** Use Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for creating insightful visualizations, presented in Tableau.

## Expected Outcomes
- A comprehensive analysis of consumer sentiment towards various sneaker brands and models based on Twitter data and sneaker website information.
- Insights into what features or aspects (e.g., comfort, design, price) drive positive or negative sentiment.
- Identification of emerging trends and consumer preferences in the sneaker market.

## 
We expect to conduct a comprehensive analysis of consumer sentiment towards various sneaker brands and models based on Twitter data and Sneaker DB information.
Insights into what features or aspects (e.g., comfort, design, price) drive positive or negative sentiment.
Identification of emerging trends and consumer preferences in the sneaker market.


# Option 2

# Healthcare Analytics Project:

This capstone project focuses on utilizing electronic health record (EHR) data to analyze patient outcomes, disease patterns, and treatment efficiency.

## Objectives (To define)
1. What are the most effective treatments for specific diseases or conditions, and how do they impact patient outcomes?
2. How do different disease patterns and comorbidities affect treatment efficacy and patient outcomes?
      
1. **Data Collection:**
   - **CDC:** Use the Twitter API to gather tweets mentioning various sneaker brands and models.
   - **NHANES:** Collect data by api calls.
   - **MIMICC-III:**  

## Methodology
- **Data Collection:** Gather electronic health record (EHR) data from healthcare institutions, ensuring compliance with data privacy and security regulations.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the collected EHR data to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data quality.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Utilize statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to analyze treatment effectiveness, disease patterns, and comorbidity impacts.
- **Visualization:** Create visualizations such as charts, graphs, and heatmaps to illustrate findings and patterns in the data.
- **Ethical Considerations:** Ensure ethical handling of patient data, anonymization where necessary, and adherence to HIPAA regulations.

## Expected Outcomes
- **Effective Treatments Identification:** Identify and rank the most effective treatments for specific diseases or conditions based on patient outcomes analysis.
- **Insightful Disease Patterns Analysis:** Gain insights into how different disease patterns and comorbidities influence treatment efficacy and patient outcomes.
- **Data-Driven Recommendations:** Provide data-driven recommendations to healthcare providers for improving treatment protocols and patient care strategies.

## Summary
The Healthcare Analytics Project aims to leverage electronic health record (EHR) data to enhance our understanding of effective treatments for various diseases, evaluate disease patterns' impact on treatment outcomes, and provide data-driven recommendations to optimize patient care. Through rigorous data analysis and statistical modeling, this project seeks to contribute valuable insights to the healthcare industry for improving treatment efficacy and patient outcomes.
